# Straight Outta Some Swiss Canton

A poster for a NWA concert.

## Original

I changed the background colour, and used a different sans-serif typeface. Otherwise, it the same as the original!

## Remix

It features a pulsating police siren with accompanying sound effects!

Fitting for the world's most dangerous rap crew.
