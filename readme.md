This is home to some art experiments to improve my web dev trickery.

The starting point is likely to be an artwork or graphic design.

Each experiment is organised into a folder. If the folder has:
- A subfolder with the title "original" - I created the original artwork in there (with some artistic license).
- A subfolder with the title "remix" -  this is where I go off and create my own thing.
- If there is neither of these subfolders, it's likely to be my own creation.
