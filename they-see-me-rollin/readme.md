# They See Me Rollin

I wanted to create something kitsch for the opening lines of Chamillionaires' song *Ridin Dirty*. 

A 3D animation came to mind with the text rolling - revolving like a roller from a steam roller.

This is what I came up with.

## Room for Improvement

There is a slight discrepancy that affects the rotation. It is imperceptible (you wouldn't notice it if I didn't mention it). I think the "roller" is not 100% symmetrical, it tilts down by a small fraction at the end of a revolution. I wasn't able to smooth this out 100%.
